# 📊 Automated Monitoring System for MEGARA – End-of-Studies Project

This project was developed during my final-year internship at **VERMEG for Banking & Insurance Software**, as part of my Business Analytics degree at Tunis Business School. The goal was to design and deploy an automated monitoring system to improve operational efficiency within MEGARA, a securities processing platform.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The system replaces a manual monitoring workflow with an automated, data-driven solution that detects anomalies and provides real-time alerts to consultants.

Key components include:
- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** to extract operational data from MEGARA’s web interface
- **Machine Learning model (XGBoost)** for real-time anomaly detection
- **Interactive dashboard** to track KPIs and process status
- **Email alert system** for proactive issue resolution
- Development following the **Agile (Scrum)** methodology and **CRISP-DM** for data mining

---

## 💡 Objectives

- Eliminate manual, error-prone monitoring tasks
- Detect performance issues early using predictive models
- Provide decision-makers with clear, real-time insights

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Automation**: Selenium (for RPA)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Dash, or Power BI (if applicable)  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 🚀 How It Works

1. RPA script logs into MEGARA and extracts operational data
2. Data is processed and fed to the ML model
3. Anomalies are flagged and displayed in a live dashboard
4. Critical issues trigger email alerts to consultants
